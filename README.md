# Camel Casing APIS

Currently queries: https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries. [This API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/01-listbreweries) was chosen because it was the first one I found that returns objects with `snake_case` keys.

## To run

```
cd camel-casing-apis
yarn
yarn dev
```
